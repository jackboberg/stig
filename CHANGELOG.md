## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Added

- Global CLI flags: `--config`, `--database-path`, `--migrations-dir`, `--backups-dir`, `--schema-path`, `--no-snapshot`, and `--no-checksum`. CLI flags now take precedence over environment variables and `stig.toml` values as documented. `--config` specifically overrides `STIG_CONFIG` (previously the env var won). When passed to `stig init`, the values of these flags are persisted into the generated `stig.toml`; for all other commands they apply only to that invocation.

### Changed

- Internal config API refactored: the public `Config` struct is replaced by a `Runtime` wrapper around a `pub(crate) ConfigFile` (the serde mirror of `stig.toml`) plus the resolved `project_root`. Path-resolution accessors (`db_path`, `migrations_path`, `backups_path`, `snapshots_path`, `resets_path`, `schema_file_path`, `is_memory_db`) now live on `Runtime`, so callers should use them instead of joining `project_root` with raw string fields. The supporting types `CliContext` and `CliOverrides` are renamed to `RunContext` and `ConfigOverrides`.
- Extracted shared `reapply_pending` into `src/migrate/mod.rs`, eliminating duplication between `redo` and `reset`. The schema-manifest fast path remains exclusive to `reset` (documented inline).
- Eliminated remaining bare `"snapshots"` / `"resets"` string literals from production code (`init.rs`) and unit tests (`snapshot.rs`). All call sites now use `Runtime::snapshots_path()` and `Runtime::resets_path()` helpers.

### Fixed

- `redo` now exits with code 2 (`Declined`) when confirmation is run in a non-TTY environment, matching `reset`, `restore`, and `backups prune`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- `restore` — restore the database from a reset backup
- `stig new` now supports `$EDITOR` values with arguments (e.g. `EDITOR="code -w"`)

### Changed

- `reset` — auto-restores the original database if re-applying migrations fails

### Fixed

- Schema manifest (`schema.sql`) application is now atomic; a failed statement no longer leaves partial DDL/INSERT state
